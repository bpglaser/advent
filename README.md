This project chronicles my efforts in completing ["Advent of Code" by Eric Wastl](http://adventofcode.com/2016).
During which, I shall attempt to use a variety of languages and paradigms.

| 03  | Squares With Three Sides   | Rust     |
| 04  | Security Through Obscurity | Kotlin   |

## Advent of Code

>Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code.
