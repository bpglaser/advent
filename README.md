## Advent of Code

>Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code.

\* ✔️ indicates that a language was known prior to the beginning of Advent of Code.

\* ✘ indicates that the language was learned for the sake of Advent of Code.
